# DeepLearning_StrawberryClassification
This project implements a deep learning strawberry classifier using a fine-tuned ResNet50 model. It distinguishes strawberry images from non-strawberry images with data augmentation and evaluation metrics, and includes an interactive Gradio interface for real-time predictions.
